As contributors and maintainers of this project, we aim to foster an open and welcoming environment. We expect all contributors to abide by this Code of Conduct in all project-related spaces.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of promoting an open and inclusive community, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We encourage all contributors to exhibit respectful and professional conduct when interacting with fellow contributors and project participants. Expected behaviors include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment and other unacceptable behavior are not tolerated. Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Offensive comments, whether related to personal characteristics or choices.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Any form of harassment, whether verbal, physical, or visual.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at sal20200779@std.psut.edu.jo. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement
